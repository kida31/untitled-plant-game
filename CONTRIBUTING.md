# Contribution guide

To get started, please follow the instructions in the [README](./README.md#getting-started).

On GitHub we work with the following workflow:

1. Create an issue
  1. Choose Asginee:s
	2. Choose a label
	3. Create project item
		- Set status, workload and start date (day you start working on it)
2. Create a branch, starting with the issue number
  If you're not doing anything within the repo (e g Notion or Wiki) skip to step 6
3. Create a merge request with 'Closing issue #<number>' in the description
   - PR comments should be resolved by the person who commented the PR
   -  Merge Conflicts should be resolved by the branch owner
    - If the PR has no conflicts anyone may press the merge button as long as it is approved
5. Wait for approval
  - Make some changes when asked for
5. Merge the branch (which automatically closes the issue)
6. Set project item status and end date (day you last worked on it)
